  Find your token on https://modit.store/account
  Click the "New Token" button associated with your order.
  Copy paste the token that is generated once the page refreshes, and overwrite the token below.
  NOTE: Must be in string format, enclosed by quotations.

  If you "lose" your token somehow, you can generate up to one new token every month using the "New Token" button on the website.
  These tokens are disposable. Every time you generate a new token, your old token will be overwritten and no longer able to access the mods associated with the order.

  If you have any issues with authorization, head to https://modit.store, and click the "contact us" link at the top of the page to receive an invitation to the support discord.
  Please allow up to 24 hours after your order has been purchased AND fulfilled before attempting to contact us about authorization.
  The system is automatic, and we should not require any notice for your authorization.
